## Update AWS Credentials for Backup System

### What needs to happen
You'll be prompted to enter two secret values:

1. **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** - The new Access Key ID you just created
2. **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** - The corresponding Secret Access Key

### Steps
1. I'll use the secret update tool to prompt you for each value
2. You paste in the keys from AWS
3. We trigger a test backup to confirm it works

This is a quick credentials update -- no code changes needed.
