## Strengthen Refund Policy -- No Refunds for Used Services

### What Needs to Change

Section 4 currently only covers Brand subscriptions and is too lenient. It needs to:
1. Cover **both** Brand subscriptions AND Creator featuring/visibility boost purchases
2. Establish a clear **"no refund if used"** rule for all paid services
3. Keep the 14-day window but make it conditional on **non-usage**
4. Define what constitutes "usage" so there's no ambiguity

### Changes to `src/pages/RefundPolicy.tsx` -- Section 4

**Rewrite Section 4** to become a comprehensive "Platform Service Refunds" section covering all paid services:

**4. Platform Service Refunds (Subscriptions & Creator Featuring)**

New subsections:

**4.1 General No-Refund Rule**
- All fees paid to CollabHunts for platform services -- including Brand subscription plans (Basic, Pro) and Creator visibility boosts (Featured Badge, Homepage Spotlight, Category Boost, Auto Popup) -- are for digital services rendered upon activation.
- Once a paid service has been used, activated, or its benefits have been accessed in any capacity, **no refund will be issued**.
- "Usage" includes but is not limited to: logging into a paid account, sending messages using paid quota, posting opportunities, activating a visibility boost, appearing in boosted search results, or accessing any feature exclusive to the paid tier.

**4.2 14-Day Review Period**
- Refund requests may be submitted within 14 calendar days of purchase to care@collabhunts.com.
- During this 14-day period, CollabHunts will investigate whether the paid service has been used or activated.
- If the investigation confirms **no usage** of the paid service occurred, a refund may be granted at CollabHunts' sole discretion.
- If any usage is detected during the investigation, the refund request will be denied.
- After 14 days from purchase, no refund requests will be considered under any circumstances.

**4.3 Brand Subscription Refunds**
- Brand subscription fees (Basic and Pro plans) are billed annually.
- You may cancel at any time, but no refund is provided for the remaining billing period.
- Upon cancellation, you retain access to paid features until the end of your current billing period.
- If you have used any paid features (messaging quota, opportunity posts, team access, etc.), no refund will be issued regardless of when the request is made within the 14-day window.

**4.4 Creator Featuring & Visibility Boost Refunds**
- Creator visibility boost purchases (Featured Badge, Homepage Spotlight, Category Boost, Auto Popup) are non-refundable once activated.
- Activation occurs immediately upon purchase confirmation. Once your boost is live and your profile has received any boosted visibility, the service is considered fully rendered.
- No partial refunds are available for unused portions of a visibility boost period.

**4.5 Refund Processing**
- All refund decisions are made at CollabHunts' sole and absolute discretion.
- Approved refunds are processed within 5-10 business days to the original payment method.
- CollabHunts reserves the right to deny any refund request without providing a reason.
- Disputing a legitimate charge with your payment provider after using our services may result in immediate account termination.

**4.6 No Double Recovery**
- If you initiate a chargeback or payment dispute with your bank or payment provider for a service you have used, CollabHunts reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate your account, pursue recovery of the disputed amount, and ban you from future use of the Platform.

### Summary

The key legal principle being enforced: **if you paid for it and used it, there is no refund.** The 14-day window exists solely for CollabHunts to verify whether the service was actually used. This protects against users who subscribe, use all the features, then request a refund.
