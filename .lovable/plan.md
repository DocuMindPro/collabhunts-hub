# Replace "Creator" with "Influencer" in Specific Locations

## Changes

Based on the screenshots, replace "Creator(s)" with "Influencer(s)" in these specific spots only:

### 1. `src/pages/Index.tsx`
- Line 151: "Find Your Creator" → "Find Your Influencer"
- Line 161: "Discover vetted creators" → "Discover vetted influencers"
- Line 200: "Vetted Creators" → "Vetted Influencers"
- Line 212: "Creator Options" → "Influencer Options"

### 2. `src/components/home/CreatorSpotlight.tsx`
- Line 148: "Featured Creators" → "Featured Influencers"

### 3. `src/components/Footer.tsx`
- Line 138: "Find Creators" → "Find Influencers"
- Line 209: "Find Creators" → "Find Influencers"

### 4. `src/pages/Influencers.tsx`
- Line 550: "Book Creators for Events" → "Book Influencers for Events"

All other occurrences of "creator" across the platform (dashboards, admin, internal references) remain unchanged -- only the user-facing spots shown in the screenshots are updated.
